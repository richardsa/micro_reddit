Let's build Reddit. Well, maybe a very junior version of it called 
micro-reddit. In this project, you'll build the data structures necessary 
to support link submissions and commenting. We won't build a front end 
for it because we don't need to... you can use the Rails console to play 
around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.

See <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-with-active-record?ref=lnav">here</a> for full instructions/details.
